This project presents an approach of optimizing a studentâ€™s route to school using graph theory implementations. The proposed approach models sections of the route as directed graphs based on dependencies and uses topological sorting algorithms to generate a hierarchical view. Traversal algorithms are then used to generate a sequence of locations as the final route. The proposed approach has several advantages over traditional scheduling methods; it is more flexible and scalable, as it can be easily adapted to different resource constraints, such as traffic or road conditions in the real world. We present a methodology for implementing these algorithms and explore outcomes of test graphs.

The file WeightedGraphExample.java implements Dijkstra's algorithm for generating a route, and the file traffic_implementation.ipynb implements gmaps API and folium to gather traffic data.
